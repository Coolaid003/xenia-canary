Hi

My GoldenEye 007 XBLA does not work on Xenia Canary, when the first game area starts, the screen goes black and only the music is playing.

I only managed to make it work on the Xenia Master from an earlier date (2020-05-18), but this does not work the patches.

I have one ADM 5700xt

Could you help me work on Xenia Canary?

Thank you very much.
